# New-York-Taxi-Demand-Forecasting

Implemented random forest regression, Extreme gradient boosting regression and Artificial neural network with hyperparameter tuning.

Used time series algorithms such as ARIMA, ARIMAX and VAR.

Made ACF and PACF plots to find the optimal moving average and auto regressive values.

Made an interactive dashboard with RShiny showing peak and off-peak hours by location; forecasted demand for a specific hour and the plot of true data vs forecasts on the testing data by model and statistical information to compare short and long-distance trips.
